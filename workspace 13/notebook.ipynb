However, it can be an expensive and time-consuming process, which can cause farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure based on their budget constraints.\n\nFarmers have various options when it comes to deciding which crop to plant each season. Their primary objective is to maximize the yield of their crops, taking into account different factors. One crucial factor that affects crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field, which can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. Each crop has an ideal soil condition that ensures optimal growth and maximum yield.\n\nA farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert for assistance in selecting the best crop for his field. They've provided you with a dataset called `soil_measures.csv`, which contains:\n\n- `\"N\"`: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil\n- `\"P\"`: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil\n- `\"K\"`: Potassium content ratio in the soil\n- `\"pH\"` value of the soil\n- `\"crop\"`: categorical values that contain various crops (target variable).\n\nEach row in this dataset represents various measures of the soil in a particular field. Based on these measurements, the crop specified in the `\"crop\"` column is the optimal choice for that field.  \n\nIn this project, you will build multi-class classification models to predict the type of `\"crop\"` and identify the single most importance feature for predictive performance.","metadata":{},"id":"d3d001b0-2e2f-4b58-8442-99520bad831f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# All required libraries are imported here for you.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n# Load the dataset\ncrops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n\n# Write your code here","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":48,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# All required libraries are imported here for you.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n# Load the dataset\ncrops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n\n# Write your code here","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1755303496158,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ca3e828d-acac-47a1-8c95-93727b90de88"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Getting Started\nI printed the info, the different types of crops (the dependent variable) and the head of the dataset to see what I was working with.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"91a6e34b-dd84-4b82-b05c-54ab73b6422c"},{"source":"print(crops.info())\nprint(crops['crop'].unique())\ncrops.head()","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"lastExecutedAt":1755303496210,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ca3e828d-acac-47a1-8c95-93727b90de88","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"print(crops.info())\nprint(crops['crop'].unique())\ncrops.head()","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":374,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"3cddf440-716b-49dd-bfae-176caa8b87e3","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 2200 entries, 0 to 2199\nData columns (total 5 columns):\n #

I then initialized an empty dictionary to store my evaluation score for each feature's model. I next created a for loop and looped through all the features to create, fit, make predictions with, and score a logistic regression model for each feature. Within the loop I appended the feature's name and the R-squared value of the feature's logistic regression model to my feature_r_squared dictionary. Upon viewing the dictionary after the for loop was run, it appeared that K, the potassium content ratio in the soil, is the best predictor of which crop was planted, with an R-squared value of 0.275. To increase confidence in my results, I performed a K-fold cross-validation on each model, using 5 folds. Just as with my first analysis, K produced the model with the highest mean R-squared across all features.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"788d8026-bec7-4ed4-b750-40b680d1c187"},{"source":"#Generating list of features\nfeatures = list(crops.drop(columns=['crop']).columns)\n#Initializing an empty dictionary to store r-squared results in for each feature\nfeature_r_squared= {}\n#Creating a for loop to loop through each feature, creating, running, and scoring the predictions of a logistic regression model for each\nfor feature in features:\n    X = crops[[feature]].values\n    y= crops[['crop']].values\n    log_reg= LogisticRegression()\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=182)\n    log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)\n    r_squared_test = log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)\n    feature_r_squared[feature] = r_squared_test\n    \nprint(feature_r_squared)    ","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":930,"lastExecutedAt":1755303497140,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ca3e828d-acac-47a1-8c95-93727b90de88","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#Generating list of features\nfeatures = list(crops.drop(columns=['crop']).columns)\n#Initializing an empty dictionary to store r-squared results in for each feature\nfeature_r_squared= {}\n#Creating a for loop to loop through each feature, creating, running, and scoring the predictions of a logistic regression model for each\nfor feature in features:\n    X = crops[[feature]].values\n    y= crops[['crop']].values\n    log_reg= LogisticRegression()\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=182)\n    log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)\n    r_squared_test = log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)\n    feature_r_squared[feature] = r_squared_test\n    \nprint(feature_r_squared)    ","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":38,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"b6f4fd30-2de7-4310-a04f-a3af9425a429","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"{'N': 0.1590909090909091, 'P': 0.2, 'K': 0.275, 'ph': 0.07045454545454545}\n"}],"execution_count":42},{"source":"from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold\nfeature_r_squared_cross= {}\n#Creating a for loop that loops through each feature and perform k-fold cross validation on its logistic regression model\nfor feature in features:\n    X = crops[[feature]].values\n    y= crops[['crop']].values\n    log_reg= LogisticRegression()\n    kf= KFold(n_splits = 5, shuffle=True, random_state=182)\n    cv_results = cross_val_score(log_reg, X, y, cv=kf)\n    feature_r_squared_cross[feature] = np.mean(cv_results)\n    \nprint(feature_r_squared_cross)   ","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4005,"lastExecutedAt":1755303501145,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ca3e828d-acac-47a1-8c95-93727b90de88","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold\nfeature_r_squared_cross= {}\n#Creating a for loop that loops through each feature and perform k-fold cross validation on its logistic regression model\nfor feature in features:\n    X = crops[[feature]].values\n    y= crops[['crop']].values\n    log_reg= LogisticRegression()\n    kf= KFold(n_splits = 5, shuffle=True, random_state=182)\n    cv_results = cross_val_score(log_reg, X, y, cv=kf)\n    feature_r_squared_cross[feature] = np.mean(cv_results)\n    \nprint(feature_r_squared_cross)   ","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":38,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"3430d7bd-7d42-4980-ab1e-496879b2dd70","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"{'N': 0.14863636363636365, 'P': 0.20363636363636362, 'K': 0.3013636363636364, 'ph': 0.09227272727272727}\n"}],"execution_count":43},{"source":"best_predictive_feature = {'K': feature_r_squared['K']}\nprint(best_predictive_feature)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":81,"lastExecutedAt":1755303501226,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ca3e828d-acac-47a1-8c95-93727b90de88","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"best_predictive_feature = {'K': feature_r_squared['K']}\nprint(best_predictive_feature)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":38,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"a4c60608-e21e-4470-baf2-7b7e01e3f845","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"{'K': 0.275}\n"}],"execution_count":44}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
